# GSBPM and GAMSO Revision

The [Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GSBPM) and [the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organisation (GAMSO)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GAMSO) are used by many statistical organisations for the standard-based modernisation. Every five years, these models are revised to ensure that they maintain their relevance.

This revision is initiated by the 2023 Work Programme of [the High-Level Group for Modernisation of Official Statistics (HLG-MOS)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/hlgbas) and will be carried out by a task team under the HLG-MOS Supporting Standards Group. If you wish to join this revision task team, please contact choii-at-un-dot-org.
