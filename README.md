# GSBPM_GAMSO_Revision

The [Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GSBPM) and [the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organisation (GAMSO)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GAMSO) are used by many statistical organisations for the standard-based modernisation. Every five years, these models are revised to ensure that they maintain their relevance.

We are seeking feedback from statistical organisations on possible improvements to GSBPM and GAMSO to inform the revision process. All feedback on the GSBPM and GAMSO are welcome. For example, you could provide comments to:

- suggest additional phase / sub-process (in the case of GSBPM) or activity (in the case of GAMSO);
- identify specific parts of the models where clarification and guidance is needed to help the implementation of the models in your organisation;
- propose changes to GSBPM and GAMSO to better address the challenges that statistical organisation face;
- comment on any general difficulties in using GSBPM and GAMSO;
- suggest changes to the wording or description for improving clarity or fixing error or inconsistencies.
 
The request for feedback on GSBPM and GAMSO will be open until 20th February 2023. You can provide your feedback via email (choii-at-un-dot-org) or post directly to [GSBPM and GAMSO revision Github issue repository](https://github.com/UNECE/GSBPM_GAMSO_Revision/issues). It is planned that draft versions of the revised models will be circulated for comments in early 2024.

This revision is initiated by the 2023 Work Programme of [the High-Level Group for Modernisation of Official Statistics (HLG-MOS)](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/hlgbas) and will be carried out by a task team under the HLG-MOS Supporting Standards Group.
